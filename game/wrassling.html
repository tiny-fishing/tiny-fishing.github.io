          <h2>Wrassling: Tips and Tricks</h2>
          <p>
            While Wrassling may seem like a simple game at first, mastering it
            requires skill and strategy. Here are some tips and tricks that will
            help you become a pro at Wrassling:
          </p>
          <h3>Timing is Everything</h3>
          <p>
            Since Wrassling is all about throwing your opponents out of the
            ring, timing is crucial. Wait for the right moment to strike and
            make sure to time your punches and grabs perfectly. Anticipate your
            opponent's moves and use the ropes to your advantage to throw them
            off balance.
          </p>
          <h3>Use the Walls</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to the ropes, you can also use the walls to your
            advantage. When your opponents are near a wall, grab them and slam
            them against it. This will cause significant damage and make it
            easier for you to push them out of the ring.
          </p>
          <h3>Unlock New Characters</h3>
          <p>
            As you progress in the game and complete achievements, you will
            unlock new characters with different abilities and appearances. Each
            character has its own strengths and weaknesses, so make sure to try
            them all out and find one that suits your playstyle.
          </p>
          <h3>Practice Makes Perfect</h3>
          <p>
            Like any other game, practice is essential for becoming a pro at
            Wrassling. Spend some time getting familiar with the controls and
            experimenting with different strategies. With time, you will become
            more confident and skilled, making it easier to defeat your
            opponents.
