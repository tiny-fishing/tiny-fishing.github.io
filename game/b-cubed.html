            <p>
            <span style="background-color:transparent;color:#495057;">The gameplay of B Cubed is straightforward and easy to learn. Players control a small red cube and must navigate it through a series of levels, each consisting of a grid-like platform floating in space. The cube moves in a straight line until it reaches an obstacle or the edge of the platform, at which point it will stop unless directed otherwise.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
            <span style="background-color:transparent;color:#495057;">The objective of each level is to reach the blue end point, which is marked by a small square. Along the way, players may encounter purple squares, which act as checkpoints and allow them to restart from that point if they make a mistake. However, players only have a limited number of checkpoints, so it is important to use them wisely.</span>

            <p>
            <span style="background-color:transparent;color:#495057;">B Cubed can be played using the arrow keys on a keyboard or by swiping on a touchscreen device. The up, down, left, and right arrows correspond to the cube's movements in those directions. Players can also use the "undo" button to reverse their last move, and the "reset" button to restart the level from the beginning.</span>

            <span style="background-color:transparent;color:#495057;">The first few levels in B Cubed serve as an introduction to the game's mechanics and are relatively easy to complete. However, as you progress, new challenges are introduced, such as portals that transport the cube to different areas of the platform, switches that open and close pathways, and moving platforms that require precise timing to navigate. The difficulty levels range from 1 to 30, with Level 30 being the most challenging and often referred to as the "impossible level."</span>

            <span style="background-color:transparent;color:#495057;">Use checkpoints wisely: As mentioned earlier, players only have a limited number of checkpoints, so use them strategically. Save them for difficult sections or when you're close to completing a level.</span>

            <span style="background-color:transparent;color:#495057;">Pay attention to the color-coded squares: Each colored square has a specific function, so make sure to understand what they do to help you navigate through levels.</span>
